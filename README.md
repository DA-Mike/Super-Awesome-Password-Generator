# Super Awesome Password Generator

## UCB Bootcamp Module #3 Challenge

My motivation for this project was to learn more about Javascript and how it interacts with the frontend. 

This project was done to challenge my Javascript abilities by creating a nifty password generator.

The assignment came with some code, but it was up to me to write the Javascript code and create the password generator myself.

This was a great learning experience, I learned a lot about functional coding and how to code Javascript to create something useful.
